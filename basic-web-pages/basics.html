    <h1> Interneting is easy </h1>
    <p>  First, add some basic html  </p>

    <h2> Headings </h2>
    <p> Headings define the outline of your site. There are six different levels of headings </p>

    <h2> Lists </h2>

    <p> This is how you make an unordered list </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Add a "ul" element. It stands for unordered list </li>
      <li> Add each element in its own "li" element </li>
      <li> They don't need to be in any particular order </li>
      <li> "ul" only accepts "li" elements</li>
      <li> <p>"li"elements allow nested paragraphs <p> </li>
    </ul>

    <p> See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul </p>
</html>

<p> This is how you make an ordered list </p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
  <li>But the list item elements are the same </li>
  <li> Also note how the the numbers increment on their own </li>
  <li> You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
  <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase </p>
  <p> Other times you need to <strong> stong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>
  <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout</strong></em></p>

  <h2> Empty Elements </h2>
  <p> Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now. </p>
  <p>Regards,<br/>
